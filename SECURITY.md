# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 6.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.x.x   | Upgrades only      |
| 4.x.x   | Upgrades only      |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

Please note that we provide full support for issues that are not due to misconfiguration for the current iteration of TGS but you must be running the latest version to receive support. Upgrading from any version >=4.0 is relatively painless. TGS3 is fully defunct and will no longer receive any support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should ideally be reported by directly messaging one of the TGS maintainers on Discord. Maintainers can be found in the [#coderbus](https://discord.gg/Vh8TJp9) guild in the [#hosting-questions](https://discord.com/channels/484170914754330625/653425022966169620) channel. Please be sure to provide reproduction steps.

Here is a list of their discord IDs.

Once reported, they will handle the processing of the security advisory.
